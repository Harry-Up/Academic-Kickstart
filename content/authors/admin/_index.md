I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at Data Mining Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). I received my Bachelors in Electronic Information Engineering from UESTC and Electronic Information Engineering from University of Glasgow (UoG), during 2013 and 2017.

My research interests are about knowledge tranfer in an interpretable manner, including interpretable machine learning, transfer Learning, continual / lifelong learning, few-shot learning, meta-learning and representation learning. Please feel free to discuss with me.
