title: Capsule Neural Network and Discussion on Synchronization Neural Network
event: Lab Seminar
event_url: ""
location: Room 311, Innovation Center, UESTC
summary: " "
abstract: "Capsule Neural Network was proposed by Hinton to tackle weaknewsses of current Artificial Neural Network. This time I would like to introduce is vividly. Meanwhile, as a kind of Synchronization Neural Network, its further potential on transfer learning and artificial intelligence would be discussed."
