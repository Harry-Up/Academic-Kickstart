title: Label Distribution Learning
event: Lab Seminar
event_url: ""
location: Room 311, Innovation Center, UESTC
summary: " "
abstract: "Multi-label is the natural attribute of things. Describing instances with one label could lead to massive loss of information. Instead of assigning a single label, attaching multiple labels to instances suffers from label ambiguity. That is because the weight of each label is different. Label distribution is introduced to adapt to the situation."
