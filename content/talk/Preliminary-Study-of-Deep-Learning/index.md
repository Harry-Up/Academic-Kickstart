title: Preliminary Study of Deep Learning
event: Lab Seminar
event_url: ""
location: Room 311, Innovation Center, UESTC
summary: " "
abstract: "Deep Neural Network has shown overwhelming performance in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc. Furthermore, it is a bio-inspired model that is intuitive and extendable. Therefore, it significantly broaden our available research area and imagination! Here, I'm going to have a breif introduction to basic deep neural network models."
