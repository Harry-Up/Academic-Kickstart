title: Representation-based Transfer Learning and Some Advances
event: Lab Seminar
event_url: ""
location: Room 311, Innovation Center, UESTC
summary: " "
abstract: "Current machine learning model is specific for the trained situation and performs poorly to others. What's worse, the model adapted to a new task requires much corresponding labeled data. In the real world, it is hard to obtain sufficient labeled data for each task. Transfer learning boosts this learning processing through transferring previous knowledge to the new case. On the way to artificial intelligence, transfer learning is wanted. In the presentation, I will introduce representation-based transfer learning and some advances."
